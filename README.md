How To Create a Music Player GUI with Python?
The first step is to choose a Python GUI framework, here I will use two main GUI libraries for creating a music player with Python:

Pygame
Tkinter
Pygame is a Python library used to create video games. To create a music player with Python, we will be using the Pygame sound component.
Then we will create functions such as play, stop, pause and resume in order to control the music player. To create these commands, we’ll build some functions and we’ll use Tkinter to create the button in the interface.

We are now going to implement all of the steps above in the section below to create a music player with Python.
Now you have your own music player and you can listen to songs using this app. Also, I think that creating such apps like a music player or other apps that you can use in your daily life can really help you get to know new Python frameworks and at the same time you will learn more about programming.
